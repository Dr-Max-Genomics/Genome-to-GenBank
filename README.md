# End-to-End Workflow: From Genome FASTA + GFF to NCBI-Ready .sqn Files
## A practical, reproducible guide for fungal genome annotation submissions

This repository documents a complete workflow for converting a genome FASTA file and a GFF3 annotation file into a validated .sqn file suitable for NCBI submission as an annotation-only update. The goal is to provide a clear, reproducible reference for preparing WGS-based fungal genome annotations for GenBank.

This guide reflects lessons learned during the annotation and submission of Fusarium cerealis strain F-23-4.4, including common pitfalls, NCBI requirements, and practical fixes.

## Overview

NCBI accepts genome annotation updates in the form of .sqn files generated by table2asn. To produce a valid .sqn, you must supply:

- A genome FASTA file containing all contigs in the WGS project
- A GFF3 annotation file containing features for contigs that have annotation
- A submission template (.sbt)
- A registered locus_tag prefix
- Correct WGS FASTA headers
- A consistent mapping between FASTA and GFF seqids

This workflow describes how to prepare these inputs, validate them, and generate a submission-ready .sqn.

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS environment
- bioawk
- table2asn (current NCBI version)
- GFF3 annotation file
- Genome FASTA file
- Registered locus_tag prefix
- Submission template (.sbt)

## 1. Prepare the Genome FASTA

NCBI requires WGS FASTA headers in the following format:

>gnl|WGS:<WGS_PREFIX>|SeqID|gb|<ACCESSION>

Example:

>gnl|WGS:JBQWEA|SeqID|gb|JBQWEA010000001.1

Do not shorten or modify this header format.

### Verify contig lengths
